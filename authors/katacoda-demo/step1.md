At its basic, Katacoda provides a live terminal window and a pane for providing guided instructions. Let's try some of the UX Features provided by Katacoda  

## Execute Commands on Terminal Window  
> Click on the command to execute it in the terminal window.  

`top`{{execute T1}}

> You can interrupt (Ctrl + C) a previously running command and execute a new command. Let's clear  the terminal.  

`clear`{{execute T1}}

> You create and run commands in a new Terminal Window  

`echo "I am Terminal 2"`{{execute T2}} 

> You can copy simple commands  

`some-command`{{copy}}

> You can also copy entire code blocks to the clipboard
